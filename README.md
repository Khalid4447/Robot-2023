# Robot-2023

## Mechanical path

Task 1: using TinkerCad base and tall were designed and other parts were merged and task ubdated in screenRobot Repo.
in /screenRobot

Task 2: connect servo motor to a frame to be used for head rotation.
in /screenRobot
## Electrical path

Task 1: arduino first used with 12 LEDs to design robot eye circuit, and with servo motor to design the motor circuit, both circuits are shown as images in circuit Repo 
in circuits/
Task 2: connect DC and servo motors to ardiono and run it using code (.ino files)
in circuits/
## ROS and AI path:

Task 1: ROS and Gazeebo installed then roslaunch robot_arm and controlled using moveit_pkg, find task in catkin_ws Repo

Task 2: Install Turtlebot3 and SLAM package and navigate using keyboard and accomplish mapping
in catckin/src

Task 3: using teachable machine from google AI recognition model used for women and men faces.
in /AI

## Web and NLP path
Task1: deign keypad of four buttons in an html page and register logs in phpmyadmin.
in /key_pad

Task2: using directions keypad draw line and register direction and length in database in phpmyadmin.
in /key_pad
## IoT path
Task1: connect ESP32 controller to an ardiono to read from html page and run corresponding LED.
in /iot

Task2: connect two arduinos in a serial connection and click pushbutton in one ardiono to enlight LED in the other arduino to prove connectivity.
